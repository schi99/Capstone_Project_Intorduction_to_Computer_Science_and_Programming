    *The original plan for this program was to provide a code that would automate the login, leading to the webscraping and calendar output creation process. However, multiple attempts revealed that this part was beyond the scope of this project due to issues related to two-factor-autentification and browser specifications. Thus, the goal was updated to include the remaining steps implemented on a HTML-document saved directly from UniPortal.*

- Use visuals such as drawings, screenshots, or plots to support your explanations

### 3.2. Results

- Explain what worked and what did not

    *The original plan was to automate the login process to UniPortal to allow a smooth process for the webscraping and calendar output creation. Attempts to create this feature were made using Selenium browser automation. However, due to the two-factor-login, this feature was deemed quite impractical, as the user would have to provide authenticator code each time they wanted to use the feature, which would make the automation pointless.*

    *To go around this issue, the next attempt  was to create a Selenium browser automation that could access a pre-existing browser window, where user had already completed the log-in process to UniPortal and subsequently automate the remaining steps. The reasoning for this step was that accessing an existing window would utilise saved cookies, therefore avoiding the problem of the two-factor autentification. The process involved use the browser's (Firefox) profiles-functionality and installation of the geckodriver. However, also this
